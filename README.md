# E-commerce_EDA_NPL

This project is an analysis of customer reviews from an e-commerce platform in Brazil. The aim is to gain insights from the data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), geospatial visualization, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By leveraging these methods, we can uncover patterns, trends, and sentiments within the reviews.

## Tools and Libraries Used
The project relied on the following tools and libraries:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- GeoPandas
- NLTK
- WordCloud

## Project Overview
The main goals of this project were:

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the customer reviews dataset.
Create a Geomap to visualize the distribution of sellers and customers across Brazil.
Apply NLP techniques to analyze the content of the reviews, including top trigrams and word clouds.
Utilize NLP to correlate review scores with textual content to infer reasons behind good or bad reviews.

## Results and Conclusions

The analysis of the e-commerce reviews dataset revealed a strong correlation between delivery dates, scores, and customer reviews. Timely deliveries positively influenced customer satisfaction, resulting in higher scores and positive reviews, while delays in delivery had a negative impact, leading to lower scores and negative reviews. . These findings emphasize the importance of prompt deliveries in shaping customer experiences and highlight the need for e-commerce platforms and sellers to prioritize efficient logistics to enhance customer satisfaction and improve review ratings.
